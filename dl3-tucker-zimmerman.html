                            <p>Ryan Wallace Zimmerman (born September 28, 1984) is an American professional baseball first baseman for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB). Zimmerman graduated from Kellam High School in Virginia Beach, Virginia and played college baseball at the University of Virginia. Phil is a real estate agent who is very confident in his work, once saying "I could sell a fur coat to an Eskimo." Phil has a severe case of coulrophobia, which is first revealed when despite Mitchell's objection, Cameron comes to Luke's party dressed as a clown. Specifically asking for music in the same vein as Fay's Time of the Last Persecution and Zimmerman's Songpoet, right down to the same kind of cover if possible. Thanks. USS HENRY W.
