When she becomes the head of the Major Crime Task Force, she is eager to prove Welcome to /r/asoiaf (https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf)'s Game of Thrones Season 8, Episode 3 Post-Episode Discussion Thread! Please note the spoiler tag as " Extended ." If you see rules violations, please use the report function to alert I've rewatched this episode about 4 times now and just as I was on the first watch, on the second watch, third watch, fourth watch ,I'm certain. I've come to a conclusion. Only a character that was not on The Night King's Radar at all could've possibly killed him. Here is why: Throughout the Episode The Long Night  The Night King keeps away from the battle until victory is all but assured. The people complaining about Arya killing him have completely ignored the context of the episode. I’ve noticed many people putting down others for enjoying season 8 and especially the third episode, people, if you liked it it’s ok I was on the edge of my seat the whole episode and I think it gave us some of the most emotional moments in the whole series, don’t let anyone tell you that you have bad taste for enjoying the episode, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Edit: and if someone hated it, they can, their opinion is just as valid as anyone’s else’s. Just don’t hate on particular. I love this show, and taking the show for what it is, leaving all book plots aside this episode still fell so flat for me. The reason game of thrones is good is because very early on it established and then abided by, a very consistent rule set. Actions have consequence. No one is coming to save you. Let’s look at a parallel between season one and season eight. Season one, Ned Stark. Stabbed in the leg, limps and walks with a cane for the remainder of his life. He is then betrayed, surrounde. 
This is my first reddit post, but after seeing the hate that episode 70 is getting (plot armor, night king died too easy, azor ahai), I wanted to throw in a few points I’ve notice, so bare with me. We have not been paying attention, this show has time and time again told us to expect the unexpected, to plan for every outcome. It’s told us that as much as you’ve believe you’re the hero, or the prince that was promised, or you’re special, you’re not. Fuck fate. No one is special. Beric # Day-After Discussion Thread Now that you've had time to let it settle in, what are your more serious reflections on last night's episode? This post is for more thought-out reactions and commentary than the general post-premiere thread. Please avoid discussing details from the S8E4 preview, unless using a spoiler tag. This thread is scoped for \ Spoilers\ Turn away now if you are not caught up on the latest episode! Open discussion of all officially aired TV events including The motivation of the Night King: This was clearly explained in the show. The Night King was created by the CotF to kill human, that's what he was trying to do. He wanted an endless night and to erase all memory of human. That's exactly what he was trying to do. I think we were just expecting some crazy twist to happen, but at least it make sense with what was said in the show. I prefer something simple that make sense with the story, that something crazy that will make no sense when rewatch. When Tyrion approaches the gates of King’s Landing to appeal to Cersei’s love for her children, he tells her to surrender for her child. Euron was standing right behind Cersei, and he just found out about “his” child moments before this scene. From Euron’s point of view, Tyrion should have no knowledge that Cersei is pregnant - Tyrion was up in the North when he slept with Cersei for the first time. It might not have been intentional on Tyrion’s part, but I think that Euron might realize. ## Fuck your theories. Fuck Azor Ahai. Fuck the Night King. amp#x200B; I am convinced that the comic book guys on here never watched the show or read the books. "We need to learn what his motivations were" There's a whole episode on that - he was created by the COTF to wage war on mankind. Because of the manner of his creation, he also bore a grudge against his creators. He had no noble purpose, no activating reason, beyond wishing to destroy all life. What more do we need? </p>
